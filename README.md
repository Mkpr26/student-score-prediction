# 🧠 Student Score Prediction Using Linear Regression

This is a simple machine learning mini-project.  
We use **Linear Regression** to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.

## 📁 Dataset

Manually created dataset with:

- **Hours Studied**
- **Scores Obtained**

## 📊 Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 Steps Performed

- Visualized the data (Hours vs Scores)
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using MAE and R²
- Made predictions and plotted the regression line

## 📌 Example Output

```
If a student studies 6.5 hours, the predicted score is: 81.5
```

## 📚 Learning Outcome

You’ll understand how linear regression works using real-world-like data, evaluation metrics, and model visualization.
